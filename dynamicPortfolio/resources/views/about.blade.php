    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am <strong>Md Rofiqul Bari Shitol</strong>, a passionate Laravel Developer with a strong desire to create dynamic, user-friendly, and functional web applications. I strive for clean code, scalability, and performance in all the projects I work on.</p>
    
    <p>With hands-on experience in Laravel, MySQL, and RESTful APIs, I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into digital solutions. Whether it's a small portfolio site or a full-scale web application, I approach every project with attention to detail and a focus on user experience.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I value learning new technologies, collaborating with others, and continuously improving my craft. I believe in building not just websites, but digital experiences that leave an impact.</p>
